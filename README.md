Ideas on a layout algorithm and browser

# layout engine

Ideally I want to render a layout that is a nested tree or scenegraph.

I can render to pixels, I think I can use branch and bound algorithm for sizing each element.

For simplicity I shall render textfields as if they are all independently flowing so that's a bounding box for each character.
